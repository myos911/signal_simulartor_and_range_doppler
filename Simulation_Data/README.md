# Simulation Data - The Single Point Scatter Simulation (used for input in Range-Doppler)

This folder is Simulation data gets dumped. In Simone's implementation, this was used to dump data. However, the most recent changes to this implementation will mean no dumps are made to this file. 
However, this file **is** as a start point for the algorithm, and requires a file in order for `scriptedsympyr.py` to run.

## Populating via Copy-Paste
GitHub does not allow files that are over a certain size. In order to populate this file, you must paste the `data_dump.pk` file from the project compendium folder called `Simulation_Data`.
