# Antenna Pattern Data - The Single Point Scatter Simulation (used for input in Range-Doppler)

This folder is where antenna data from the simulator gets dumped and used. In Simone's implementation, this used for the algorithm 

Since this file **is** as a start point for the algorithm, it requires a file in order for `scriptedsympyr.py` to run succesfully.

## Populating via Copy-Paste
